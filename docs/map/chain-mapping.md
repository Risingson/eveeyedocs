# Chain Mapping

## Mechanics

 - While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump
   bridges will get mapped automatically.
 - Wormhole connections get removed after 48h. You can always remove them manually by clicking the connection line and selecting `Remove Connection` from the solarsystem menu.
 - A connection will get created when jumping a cyno. Stop sync before
   jumping or remove the connection created manually.
 - For wormhole systems there is no api data available for recent jumps
   or NPC kills.
 - Phenomenons are stated as an extra sub-label. To view its effects
   click the wormhole and select `Show Info` from the menu and switch to the `WH` tab.

## Display Styles
Solarsystem oultines are solid or dashed. 
Connection lines are colored and solid or dashed.

|Type| Meaning |
|--|--|
| Dashed system outline | Shattered wormhole |
| Blue lines | Not end of life |
| Red lines | End of life |
| Solid lines | Stability not reduced |
| Dashed line | Stability reduced|
| Large gap dashed line| Stability critical |
| Dotted line| Frigate sized |

## Add data to connections
To add data to connections you can click wormhole connection lines or click wormholes in the solarsystem info pane within the "SIG" tab.
You can edit:<br>

 - Signature codes on both sides<br>
 - K162 side<br>
 - Wormhole code<br>

In solarsystem info pane's `SIG` tab you can drag pasted wormhole signatures onto wormhole connections to merge the signature code. This will stop that sig from being displayed under signatures. 

## Name wormholes
Clicking wormhole systems will show a `Set Wormhole Name` option in solarsystem menu.

## Routing
Wormhole connections can be used for plotting [routes](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sync/waypoints/).
