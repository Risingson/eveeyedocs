# Structures
Citadels and POS can be pasted to browser versions of eveeye. On mobile apps however you can add them manually aswell. Structures are shared by pilots within your group.

## Pasting
You can copy and paste structures from the EVE's directional scanner using `Ctrl+C` an paste them on the active browser window of Eveeye.
Using `Ctrl+V` will `ADD` structures to the system.
   
Citadels get pasted to the system they are in (since the system's name is contained in the data from directional. Control Towers get pasted to your current location. 

## STA tab
Pasting structures will open the `STA` info tab of solarsystem info pane. In that tab npc-stations and player owned structures get shown. 

You can edit info on structures by right-clicking them or tapping them on mobile.
               
A structure can be deleted by clicking the `X` top right of it and confirm.

You can clean a system from structures as a whole by doubleclicking the `little trash bin` to the right within in the "CITADELS" headline.
