# Desktop app
The desktop app uses [nw.js](https://nwjs.io/) and points that installable browser to eveeye.com.

## Installation
### Windows

The installation software used is [Inno Setup](https://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
[Windows installer download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/002r29fwgwcxjr2/Eveeye_v003.exe?dl=0)

If you do not trust the installer you can build on your own as described for Mac and Linux below.

### Mac and Linux
I am sorry but i got no installer available for those platforms. 
If you are capable of stuff like this see the [developer page](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers/).

!!! help "Help needed"
    If you can do a working package for one of those platforms i would be happy if you could provide it via github and let me know. See [developer page](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers/).
